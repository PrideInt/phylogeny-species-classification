# Learning and Predicting Phylogeny: Harnessing Reverse Image Generating AI to Power Machine Learning Techniques to Predict the Genus of a Angiosperms
Observing evolutionary biology and phylogenetic classification of a species by way of selecting features that are prevalent and observing
similarities among species that collectively share these derived traits, which are in the form of **features**.

## Feature Selection

I'll be using **recursive feature elimination**; I'll create a subset of features by removing features that won't be necessary or are redundant
and obsolete to determine my predicted value/genus. *Note: some of these removed features can be analyzed, after preprocession.
Maybe to observe convergent evolution?*

## Model

Feature selection elimination -> decision tree modeling pipeline sounds viable. Decision tree overfitting can be solved with feature selection.
I could also use this method to possibly generate a phylogenetic tree as well.

> *In the process of designing a suitable dataset structure, as binary 0s and 1s for yes/no and unique assigned codes won't work well. I need to work with
discrete variables.*
